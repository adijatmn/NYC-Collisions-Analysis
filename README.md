# NYC-Collisions-Analysis

![Dashboard Snapshot](./NYC%20COLLISIONS%20DASHBOARD.jpg)


### 🔍 Overview  
This project analyzes motor vehicle collisions across New York City to uncover how time, location, and driver behavior influence accident trends. The findings support the NYPD and NYC Department of Transportation in improving road safety and reducing traffic incidents.  

The core areas of this project focuses on:  
▸ Temporal trends — identifying high-risk days and hours  
▸ Location patterns — spotting accident-prone streets and areas  
▸ Cause analysis — understanding key contributing factors  
▸ Casualty distribution — examining injury trends among motorists, passengers, and pedestrians  

### 💡 Why This Project is Useful  
This project provides data-driven insights into road hazard patterns and accident trends across New York City. By analyzing trends in time, location, and human behavior, it supports authorities and decision-makers in making informed safety improvements.  
  
### 📊 Key Findings  
▸ March recorded the highest number of collisions before a gradual decline.  
▸ Fridays had the most collisions, likely due to end-of-week traffic surges.  
▸ Belt Parkway recorded the highest number of accident crashes.  
▸ The leading cause of collisions was Driver Inattention/Distraction.  
▸ Peak accident hours occurred between 7–9 AM and 4–7 PM.  
▸ Motorists accounted for the majority of injuries reported.
  
### ✅ Recommendations  
▸ Launch awareness campaigns targeting driver distraction.  
▸ Improve traffic control measures during rush hours, especially on Fridays.  
▸ Prioritize road safety improvements on high-risk routes such as Belt Parkway.  
▸ Use data monitoring systems to identify and respond to emerging hotspots.  
▸ Foster data-informed decision-making for safer urban mobility.
